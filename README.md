# LSRP Scoreboard

A NUI Scoreboard for GTA V based platform FiveM. The scoreboard is written in React using Mantine library.

I tried to optimize UI as much as possible to prevent unnecessary reloads as well as trying updating configurable data through LUA meaning you do not need to rebuild for most config changes.
